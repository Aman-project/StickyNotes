## üìù Overview

Sticky Notes is a lightweight, responsive web application that allows you to create, customize, and organize digital sticky notes. The application is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices with a focus on simplicity and usability.

All notes are saved locally in your browser, so they persist between sessions. This makes it perfect for quick to-do lists, reminders, or jotting down ideas.
